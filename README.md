# Quantum Raffle Deep Dive

Quantum Raffle is a speculative PulseChain experience with massive prize potential. Winners are determined in a fair, transparent, and automated fashion.

The purpose of Quantum Raffle is to:

1. create an engaging, high ROI potential onchain experience other than the shit ticker rat race. 
2. Be an attention catching promotional narrative for PulseChain. At this point shilling yet another ticker to external audiences falls on deaf ears, perhaps shilling a $1M+ grand prize could have better onboarding results. 

## How it Works

Quantum Raffle Tickets cost 200k PLS which goes into two prize pools: 80% goes into the Grand Prize Pool and 20% goes into the Virality Bonus Prize Pool. The game ends when 30 minutes goes by without any new raffle tickets purchased and the grand prize winners are determined through sacred quantum geometry. 

### Grand Prize

The Grand Prize is split equally amongst the last purchaser, the 10th from last, the hundredth from last, and on and on depending on how many tickets were sold. The number of prize winners is equal to the number of digits in the final raffle entrant count. For example, If 12,345 Tickets were sold, there would be 5 Grand Prize winners, each receiving 395,040,000 PLS ( 12345 tickets times 200000 PLS times 80% divided by 5 winners.)

### Virality Bonus

The Virality Bonus is split amongst all users based on how early they entered the raffle. This is an incentive for participants to promote the raffle. 

When you buy a raffle ticket, you are sorted into teams based on the number of digits in the ID number on your raffle ticket.

Team 1: #1 - #9

Team 2: #10 - #99

Team 3: #100 - #999

Team 4: #1000 - #9999

And on and on…

Once a team completely fills up, 20% of their entry cost is split up equally amongst all the teams that were already fully formed. For example, once team 4 fills up, 9000 * 200k * 20% is divided amongst Teams 1, 2, and 3. Team 1 splits over 9 people, team 2 splits over 90 people, Team 3 splits over 900 people. 

Since lower number teams divide their prize over a smaller number of people you want to join a team ASAP. This balances out the statistical property of the grand prizes being heavily weighted towards the later participants. 

Since Team 1 Virality Bonus is so large, their raffle ticket cost will be 2M PLS such that their “cost basis” is equal to team 2.

### Game Theory Analysis

As the grand prize pool grows, the risk/reward ratio for a new entry converges to a point where it doesn’t make sense NOT to enter since the raffle ticket cost is fixed and the grand prize grows. 

If you believe this flywheel effect can occur, you should consider racing to join one of the smaller teams and you will earn multiples on your entry costs.
